RocketSled is a PHP 5.3 Framework that doesn't do anything - so why not use it?

I'll put some better documentation here later, but for now I've included
three demo packages one, two, user and stumpy that show you how namespacing
and stuff is used.

Basically the approach is that you don't need to namespace anything unless
you have a class name collission in which case namespacing helps you
out of a jam.

Thusly two classes are included in the package tree called Test and the
sample code demonstrates how the user\Using class can choose which Test
class to use by uncommenting the namespace statement on line 2 and
running:

php index.php

You can also point your browser at index.php and ... 

point your browser at index.php?r=Test OR ...

point your browser at index.php?r=two\Test

So basically you can run any class by implementing the class Runnable.

Take a look at packages/stumpy/autoload.php

Also take a look at packages/user/runnable.default.php
