RocketPack ... autloads ... don't need to cache

You just create a common php file that has this in it:

<?php return array(
          'http://github.com/blah/blah' => array('version'  => array(0,1,0),
                                                 'autoload' => 'bootstrap.php',
                                                ),
      );

Then in your rocketpack.config.php you loop through and add all your foreign
dependencies installing them in RocketSled::lib_dir(), then in rs.config.php
loop through and include:

foreach($package as $name => $data)
    require_once(RocketSled::lib_dir().'/'.RocketPack::dirname($name,$data['version']).'/'.$data['autoload']);


EXTENDING:

 use an autoload like:

    RocketSled::autoload(CachingAutoload::autoload());

How does CachingAutload get found? It has an autoload register in rs.config.php...

if you were also caching your configs:

    RocketSled::configs(CachingConfigs::configs());

So in *this* case, if you wanted to cache both configs and autoload to prevent any
directory scanning, you would need your configs override to provide a bootstrap.php file like:

    require_once(RocketSled::$rs_dir.'/CachingConfigs/bootstrap.php');
    
    that would do:
    
    require_once(__DIR__.'/caching_configs.class.php');
    RocketSled::configs(CachingConfigs::configs());

    

    then CachingAutoload can just do:

    if(!$ret = self::cached($class))
    {
        $default = RocketSled::defaultAutoload();
        $ret = self::cache($class,$default($class));
    }
    
    return $ret;
    
or if you had a package that you wanted to use for routing:



RocketSled knows about:

 rs_dir: the parent directory of the RocketSled package
 lib_dir: the directory in which shared, external libs are stored
 userland_dir: the directory in which user/application specific packages are installed
 root_dir: the directory in which the main entry point of the application is being executed

The default autoload and config functions will scan these
for classes and package specific config files.

Other packages may also use these, for example Murphy
or RocketPack to scan for config files.

You can override lib dir or userland dir:

RocketSled::lib_dir('/usr/share/php/');
//USEFUL IF YOU'RE INCLUDING RS FROM A SUB DIR
RocketSled::userland_dir('.');


the simplest rocketsled application just does:

require('../RocketSled/rocket_sled.class.php');
RocketSled::run();

You can also override the autoload, configs and runnable functions
by passing in closures:

RocketSled::autoload(function()
{
    require('all_my_classes.php');
});

RocketSled::configs(function()
{
    require('all_my_configs.php');
});

RocketSled::runnable(function()
{
    return MyDespatcher::runnable();
});

For example if you wanted to create a package
to do pretty URL routing, called MyUrlRouter,
or if you wanted to use Symfony's routing 
framework, you could put this in your
bootstrap.php file:

$hosts = array(
    'host1' => 'local',
    'host1' => 'live',
);

$rs_dirs = array(
    'local' => '..',
);

$lib_dirs = array(
    'local' => '..',
);

require($rs_dirs[$hosts[gethostname()]].'/RocketSled/rocket_sled.class.php');
//IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE STATIC MEMBER VARS ARE SETUP 
//PRIOR TO THIS METHOD EXECUTING WE CAN USE __callStatic
//FOR ALL OF THESE TO DISPATCH THE ACTUAL METHOD CALLS
RocketSled::runnable(function()
{
    $default_runnable = RocketSled::$default_runnable;
    if(!$ret = MyUrlRouter::runnable())
        $ret = $default_runnable();
    
    return $ret;
});

---

NOW RocketPack ... by default, packages are installed
in the same directory as the rocketpack.config.php file
appears.

However, you can override this behaviour by passing
in a directory to place the packages into the verify()
method eg.

    RocketPack\Dependencies::register(function()
    {
        //INSTALL ROCKETSLED DEPENDENCIES IN THE SAME DIR AS RS ITSELF
        RocketPack\Dependency::forPackage('https://github.com/iaindooley/RocketPack')
        ->add('https://github.com/iaindooley/Args',array(0,1,0))
        ->add('https://github.com/iaindooley/Murphy',array(0,1,1))
        ->verify(RocketSled::$rs_dir);

        //INSTALL EXTERNAL PACKAGES IN THE LIB DIR
        RocketPack\Dependency::forPackage('https://github.com/iaindooley/RocketPack')
        ->add('https://github.com/zend/ZDF','v1.1')
        ->verify(RocketSled::$lib_dir);
    });

NOW .. you can pass in a call back to the RocketPack add() method which will
require a package specific autoload implementation or bootstrap file.
RocketPack will pass in the directory path into which the package was installed
(which will either be the parent directory in which the package itself was
installed, or the directory you pass into the verify() method):

        RocketPack\Dependency::forPackage('https://github.com/iaindooley/RocketPack')
        ->add('https://github.com/zend/ZDF','v1.1',function($install_directory)
        {
            require_once($install_directory.'/boostrap.php');
        })
        ->verify(RocketSled::$lib_dir);

If you have passed a directory into the verify() method, and a version string,
then the version string will be appended to the name of the directory that 
the package installs as ONLY IF the directory passed in differs from 
RocketSled::$userland_dir

This will be included in the $install_directory method passed into the callback
function provided as the third argument.

RocketPack\Dependency::forPackage('https://github.com/iaindooley/RocketPack')
->add('https://github.com/zend/ZDF','v1.1')
->verify(RocketSled::$lib_dir);

OF COURSE THIS WON'T ACTUALLY WORK UNLESS YOU EXECUTE ROCKETPACK ON EVERY
SCRIPT EXECUTION WHICH WE DON'T WANT TO DO ... HMM BACK TO THE DRAWING
BOARD

OR ACTUALLY MAYBE RATHER THAN PASSING A CLOSURE AS THE THIRD ARGUMENT TO
RocketPack ADD YOU JUST PASS THE PATH OF THE BOOTSTRAP FILE FOR THAT PACKAGE
AND THEN THESE ARE SAVED IN A CONFIGURATION FILE WHICH IS PARSED BY
RocketPack if it exists. If it doesn't exist, RocketPack will execute,
so you can either run RocketPack by just running your application and
using the RocketPack config operation or by running it explicitly

For Murphy, it will need to scan rs_dir and userland_dir for murphy tests
and the exclude/include need to be changed to work with this method.

Something like Plusql can be installed either in a lib dir or a common 
dir, indeed the goal of most Rocketsled packages is to be externally
useful and not depend on RocketSled (save for an rs.config.php OR
rocketpack.config.php file).

    $packages = NULL;

Basic ways to use this:
rs_dir, userland_dir, lib_dir all the same, root_dir 
is the directory from which i rocketsled was included

<?php
    require_once('../RocketSled/rocket_sled.class.php');
    RocketSled::run();

Subdir:
set userland_dir to rs_dir to avoid scanning parent dir
<?php
    require_once('RocketSled/rocket_sled.class.php');
    RocketSled::userland_dir(RocketSled::rs_dir());
    RocketSled::run();

Shared codebase: //this should be in RsBoilerplate

<?php
    $hosts = array(
        'york.workingsoftware.com.au' => 'local',
        'caravan.workingsoftware.com.au' => 'live',
    );
    
    $rs_dirs = array(
        'local' => '..',
        'live' => '/usr/share/php/rs-common',
    );
    
    $lib_dirs = array(
        'live' => '/usr/share/php/libs',
    );
    
    require_once($rs_dirs[$hosts[gethostname()]].'/RocketSled/rocket_sled.class.php');
    
    if(isset($lib_dirs[$hosts[gethostname()]]))
        RocketSled::lib_dir($lib_dirs[$hosts[gethostname()]]);

    RocketSled::run();

NB: you will only ever include runnable.config.php in your main userland package
